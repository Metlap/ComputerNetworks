NDNcomm 2015 Hackathon Call for Projects
Proposals Due: Aug. 31, 2015. Hackathon: Sept. 26-27, 2015.

The NDNcomm 2015 Hackathon solicits project proposals that advance the state of NDN. 

We are looking for projects that:
directly address a research need,
create new NDN tools or modify existing tools, and/or
create or improve documentation and how-to guides.

Participants will have approximately 12 hours to work on the projects (see http://ndncomm.github.io for additional details).

How open-ended should proposals be?
Ideally, project proposals should include room for discussion and cooperative design during the hackathon, but may be entirely planned in advance (e.g. a new NFD feature). We ask that proposals avoid larger projects that are completely open to design. The significance of the contribution is more important than spectacle.
