NDNcomm 2015 Hackathon Call for Projects
Proposals Due: Aug. 31, 2015. Hackathon: Sept. 26-27, 2015.

The NDNcomm 2015 Hackathon solicits project proposals that advance the state of NDN. 

We are looking for projects that:
directly address a research need,
create new NDN tools or modify existing tools, and/or
create or improve documentation and how-to guides.

Participants will have approximately 12 hours to work on the projects (see http://ndncomm.github.io for additional details).

How open-ended should proposals be?
Ideally, project proposals should include room for discussion and cooperative design during the hackathon, but may be entirely planned in advance (e.g. a new NFD feature). We ask that proposals avoid larger projects that are completely open to design. The significance of the contribution is more important than spectacle. 

Who will work on the projects?
Hackathon projects will be developed by small teams (< 8) and should be able to show measurable progress after two days. Participants will be encouraged to regroup and refresh overnight. The hackathon welcomes all interested participants, regardless of NDN experience, so we are seeking projects that are suitable for experienced NDN developers as well as those approachable by newcomers. For example, a project could decompose into tasks of varying skill levels or, alternatively, be specifically targeted.
